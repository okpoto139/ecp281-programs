The brain is complex, in humans it consists of about 100 billion neurons, making on the order of 100 trillion connections. But we compared to digital devices like he super computer. Which has a more problem-solving power the brain or the super computer?
    Computers has been built and programmed to defeat human mastery in different area of life but in my own opinion, the brain still triumphs over computers in numerous real-word tasks. The computer works on set of instructions which are given to it by the user, which remains constant once it is programmed, even when it meets problems which are different from the one it has been programmed to work on, it still sticks to the already given instruction until a reverse instruction is given to it. 
The human brain in the other sense has the ability to do counter-operations when it sees a condition which is unfavorable to it when performing  specific task even when a different instruction is given to it.
